# NewYahooHistoricDataGrabber
Yahoo Finance changed their API for downloading historic data, breaking a lot of existing scripts and modules, and making a lot of people sad.

This program allows historic data to be retrieved again.  (Its a work in progress at the moment, so please, no comments about the lousy code quality)

Only works on Windows

## Usage

```
YahooFinanceHistoricData.exe <symbol> <name>
```

eg

```
YahooFinanceHistoricData.exe MSFT Microsoft
```
